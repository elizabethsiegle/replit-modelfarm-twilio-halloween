### Happy Halloween! Make a scary phone call with AI (Replit Model Farm)
[Try out the web app here](https://replit-modelfarm-twilio-halloween-lizziesiegle.replit.app/)

This app uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) and [Replit Model Farm](https://blog.replit.com/modelfarm)

- [get your Twilio credentials here and a phone number here](https://twilio.com/try-twilio) to send the SMS and Phone call
- [make a Streamlit account here](https://streamlit.io/) to build the web app in Python (and take in user input of phone #, what they're scared of, what they like...)

Fork the repo, add your Twilio credentials as `Secrets`, and hit `Run` in Replit.

This app uses the Amazon Polly Brian voice--[you can replace it with one of the voices here if you wish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html). It also edits the voice with SSML tags like prosody--more info on those found [here in the Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say/text-speech).
